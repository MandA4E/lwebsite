                        </div>
                        <p class = "lead">Yes. Happy birthday bub. :). First of all, I hope you like this alright. If you remember, this is what made me sad about two nights ago, putting this all together. I always cry now thinking about you, and it's not because you're going to die. It's because I'm leaving someone that had the most impact in my life thus far and someone that I care the most ever. Sorry for being a headache and a grumpy bub. When I thought about doing something for you, I know my options are always limited. I want to make this and write this to say my thank you to you baby.</p>
                        <p class = "lead">Man. It's a year and a half with you baby. It's still just like yesterday that I'd stay up until 2 for you to text me back and the times that we'd stay back to talk about the economic state of the world :). The happiest day of my life was when I came back from driver's ed and you were waiting to "talk" :p. It's still crazy that we've been through all those things during this year and a half. From my lows and the highest of highs, you stood by my side. Regardless of anything. I don't regret anything I did with you or my choice or whatever the hell there is. I do regret one thing. I regret spending time with you for granted. I wish I have simply been there for you more and spend more of my days with you. Thank you for being there when I needed the most support from someone. Thank you for being the sunshine in my days. Thank you for being the best girlfriend I can ever ask for. And most importantly, thank you for making me human again.
                         <br> <br> I wish I can write more. I'll write more when time progresses. I'll fix this as time progresses. I'll make this better :) with more stuff for us to do on this site. For the time being, enjoy your birthday (the rest of your day or night depending when I show this to you). I'm proud of how far you've come and the strong woman you are. Even though I leave in 15 full days, I leave the days behind me. I just want to dedicate this to you, my girlfriend, partner-in-crime, best friend, and my love. I love you 3001 (still more than Iron Man :p). </p>
                        <p class = "lead"> Love (Not FROM), <br> Mike</p>
